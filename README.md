3. Design: Create architectural and detailed design plans for the software.
4. Development: Write and compile the code according to the design specifications.
5. Testing: Verify that the software works as intended and fix any bugs.
6. Deployment: Release the software to users and ensure it is operational.
7. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, fix issues, and update the software as needed

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.  
**Answer**     
| Feature/Aspect       | Waterfall Methodology                                                                 | Agile Methodology                                                                 |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process**          | Sequential, linear approach                                                           | Iterative, cyclical approach                                                      |
| **Documentation**    | Emphasizes thorough documentation at each stage                                       | Focuses on regular communication and collaboration                                |
| **Flexibility**      | Less flexible; changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed           | Highly flexible; changes can be made at any stage based on feedback               |
| **Appropriate For**  | Projects with well-defined requirements and low likelihood of changes (e.g., construction projects, government contracts) | Projects with evolving requirements and a need for rapid delivery (e.g., software development, startups) |

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Key Skills: Leadership, communication, time management, and risk management   

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.   
**Answer**   
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) Importance:** IDEs streamline the development process by integrating essential tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers into a single interface. This enhances productivity, improves code quality, and simplifies debugging.  
**Examples:**   
1. Visual Studio Code
2. IntelliJ IDEA.

**Version Control Systems (VCS) Importance:** VCS manage changes to source code over time, enabling collaboration, tracking revisions, and maintaining code integrity3. They are crucial for team-based development and continuous integration.  
**Examples:**  
1. Git
2. Subversion (SVN).

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.  
**Answer**  
**Vague Prompt**  
“Tell me about software.”  

**Improved Prompt**  
“Act as a Grade 2 teacher, explain in simple term what a software is, provide a relatable example.”  

**Explanation**  
The improved prompt is more effective because it;  
Specifies the Topic: Focuses on a particular aspect of software (programming paradigms).  
Clarifies the Request: Clearly asks for differences and examples.  
Provides Context: Indicates the need for examples, making the response more informative and relevant.
